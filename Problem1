b) File Management: a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its contents.

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % touch file1.txt

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % ls -l

total 0 -rw-r--r-- 1 vaishnavikulkarni staff 0 Feb 27 12:25 file1.txt 
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % cat file1.txt

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % echo "Hello,This is a test file for LinuxAssignment." > file1.txt
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % cat file1.txt

Hello,This is a test file for LinuxAssignment. 
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % echo "Hello, I am Vaishnavi Kulkarni, This is anew file in LinuxAssignment names as file1.txt" > file1.txt

c) Directory Management: a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % cd ~/LinuxAssignment

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % pwd

/Users/vaishnavikulkarni/LinuxAssignment vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % mkdir docs

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % ls -l

total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 vaishnavikulkarni staff 64 Feb 27 12:35 docs -rw-r--r-- 1 vaishnavikulkarni staff 88 Feb 27 12:29 file1.txt 
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % ls -ld docs

drwxr-xr-x 2 vaishnavikulkarni staff 64 Feb 27 12:35 docs

d) Copy and Move Files: a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % cd ~/LinuxAssignment

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % pwd

/Users/vaishnavikulkarni/LinuxAssignment 
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % cp file1.txt docs/file2.txt

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % ls -l docs

total 8 -rw-r--r-- 1 vaishnavikulkarni staff 88 Feb 27 12:40 file2.txt 
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % cat docs/file2.txt

Hello, I am Vaishnavi Kulkarni, This is anew file in LinuxAssignment names as file1.txt 
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment %

e) Permissions and Ownership: a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and 
execute permissions for the owner and only read permissions for others.
Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to the current user.

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % cd ~/LinuxAssignment

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % chmod u=rwx,g=r,o=r docs/file2.txt

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % ls -l docs/file2.txt

-rwxr--r-- 1 vaishnavikulkarni staff 88 Feb 27 12:40 docs/file2.txt 
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment %

f) Final Checklist: a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to ensure that all operations were performed correctly.

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % ls -l docs/file2.txt

-rwxr--r-- 1 vaishnavikulkarni staff 88 Feb 27 12:40 docs/file2.txt

g) File Searching: 
a. Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories. 
b. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific word to search).

vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % find . -type f -name "*.txt"

./file1.txt
./docs/file2.txt
./extracted_docs/docs/file2.txt
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % grep "Hello" file-name.txt

grep: file-name.txt: No such file or directory
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % grep "Hello" file1.txt    

Hello, I am Vaishnavi Kulkarni, This is anew file in LinuxAssignment named as file1.txt
vaishnavikulkarni@Vaishnavis-MacBook-Air LinuxAssignment % grep --color "Hello" file1.txt

Hello, I am Vaishnavi Kulkarni, This is anew file in LinuxAssignment named as file1.txt
